Hello Accessibility: UIAccessibility Teaching Tool
==========================================

An extremely simple application built to use as a teaching tool for Accessibility for iOS.

The application consists of:
* A header of static text at the top
* Two image buttons
* A custom-drawn view

The application can be used to easily live code accessibility demos, adding labels, traits, etc. to the header / buttons as well as creating an accessibility container with the custom-drawn view. An example of added AX is found in the AX branch of this project.
